1/18/17 Notes

CSS reset: override browser-specific format, style.css brings in the reset file
nav: new elements for semantic
figure, figurecaption: new, relate text+images 
aside: secondary caption
article: An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site.
float tends to break things, need to clear things

CSS background targets all subcategories (imgae, color)
inine display, block display
vendor prefixing
em vs rem for sizing (rem = CSS3, more absolute)
