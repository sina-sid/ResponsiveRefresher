                    <h1>New features in HTML5</h1>
                    <h2>Making the web better since 2014-ish. Or maybe 2010-ish. Or maybe 2012-ish.</h2>
                    <p>HTML5 is loaded with a bunch of new features, but one of the most important is the addition of a bunch of new elements which carry semantic meaning. Those include elements such as:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>main</li>
                        <li>article</li>
                        <li>section</li>
                        <li>aside</li>
                        <li>header</li>
                        <li>footer</li>
                        <li>and others</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The addition of these elements makes it easier for us to structure content on the web in a semanically clear but rich and nuanced manner. That HTML5 has only been fully, officially "complete" since 2014 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5#History" target="_blank">(history)</a> is surprising because certain features of HTML5 have been supported by browsers even as the release has been finalized.</p>

                    <h3>Did you know?</h3>
                    <p>Al Gore is sometimes falsely said to have invented the internet. He did, however, create and introduce the High Performance Computing Act of 1991, a bill intended to "to provide for a coordinated Federal program to ensure continued United States leadership in high-performance computing" which many people believe made it possible for the internet to develop into what it is today. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Performance_Computing_Act_of_1991" target="_blank">source</a></p>

                    <h1>New features in CSS3</h1>
                    <h2>Bigger and better</h2>
                    <p>CSS3 has increased to account for more interaction behaviors, along with more sophisticated visual presentation capabilities. The addition of properties such as <em>transform</em>, <em>transition</em>;the ability to express color using an <em>rgba model</em> and to affect object opacity; and the widely supported use of <em>@keyframes</em> and <em>@media</em> allow CSS to do what prior would have required more complex javascript.</p>
